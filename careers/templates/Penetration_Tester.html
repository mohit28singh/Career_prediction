							<p style="font-size:16px;" >Penetration testers, also known as “ethical hackers,” are highly skilled security specialists that spend their days attempting to breach computer and network security systems. These testers work in the information technology (IT) field to ensure that those without authorization cannot access an organization’s data. They do this by trying to hack into networks to identify potential vulnerabilities in the system. </p>

							<p style="font-size:16px;">Penetration testers help businesses and organizations identify and resolve security vulnerabilities and weaknesses affecting their digital assets and computer networks. Some hold in-house positions with permanent employers, functioning as part of internal cybersecurity or information technology (IT) teams. Others work for specialized firms that provide penetration-testing services to end clients.</p>
