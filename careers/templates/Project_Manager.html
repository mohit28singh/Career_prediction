							<p style="font-size:16px;" >A Project Manager is responsible for planning, overseeing and leading projects from ideation through to completion.

                            <p style="font-size:16px;" >These project managers oversee projects until they are finished, and evaluate them to determine whether follow-up projects are necessary and what changes can be made for the future. This job may also involve overseeing various personnel and departments to ensure their collaboration. Some positions require certification, such as project management professional certification, and a bachelor’s degree or higher in information technology, computer science, or a related field may also be required.
