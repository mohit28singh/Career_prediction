							<p style="font-size:16px;" >Hardware engineers design the technology of the future. Using their solid knowledge of computer components and how they function, these skilled professionals play an important role in the development of a variety of useful products. They may, for instance, create new video game consoles, make improvements to mobile phones, or develop intelligent automotive systems. Hardware engineers frequently work full time in research labs and high-tech manufacturing firms, usually in large metropolitan areas. Some find positions in academia or with the federal government. The career path of a hardware engineer may lead to becoming a senior hardware design engineer, a computer and information systems manager, or a design engineering manager.</p>

							<h2>Skills required</h2>
							<p style="font-size:16px;">A strong background in math, science, and computer science is a must for aspiring hardware engineers. They also, however, should be adept communicators capable of conveying instructions in verbal and written forms. Other critical skills include</p>
							
							<ol style="font-size:16px;">
								<li>Teamwork - designing a product involves collaborating with other relevant parties, such as software engineers</li>
								<li>Creativity – thinking outside the box results in innovative designs and novel solutions to problems</li>
								<li>Problem-solving skills – the ability to approach complex issues with curiosity and determination rather than frustration serves hardware engineers well</li>
								<li>Analytic thinking – logically examining the steps taken and the outcome helps hardware engineers make corrections and produce better results</li>
								<li>Multitasking – hardware engineers may work on different projects simultaneously and need to be aware of competing deadlines and priorities</li>
							</ol>

							<h2>Educational Requirements</h2>
							<p style="font-size:16px;">The minimum educational requirement is generally a bachelor’s degree in computer engineering or a similar discipline, though a master’s degree can increase job prospects. Graduating from a school with an ABET-accredited program also may attract a hiring manager’s attention. For hardware engineers looking to move into leadership positions, obtaining an MBA can be a smart move. All in this field should be prepared to continue taking classes throughout their career in order to stay up to date on technological advances.</p>
