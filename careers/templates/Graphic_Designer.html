							<p style="font-size:16px;" >The Graphic Designer job includes the entire process of defining requirements, visualizing and creating graphics including illustrations, logos, layouts and photos. Graphic Designer will be the one to shape the visual aspects of websites, books, magazines, product packaging, exhibitions and more.</p>

							<p style="font-size:16px;">Graphic Designer should capture the attention of those who see them and communicate the right message. For this, one need to have a creative flair and a strong ability to translate requirements into design. The goal is to inspire and attract the target audience.</p>

                            <p style="font-size:16px;">Graphic designers use their artistic abilities to communicate ideas, inform consumers, and solve problems. From the layout of a website to large images seen on billboards, graphic designers create visual concepts by hand or by computer to help others interpret the world around them through color, texture, images, and symbols. Graphic designers can be found in many industries and may be responsible for all aspects of a company's design process, or they might specialize in a particular field such as advertising, digital design, illustration, or branding. Some work independently as freelancers, while others are part of a design studio, a creative agency, or a corporate company.</p>
